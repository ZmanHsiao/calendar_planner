# Application Description
We wish to help the average student have more structure and to be more on top of their responsibilities. We know that most students at our age struggle with procrastination and motivation to do things on time. We wish to create a project which can assist the student in being more productive and on top of their plans. Our idea for the project is a schedule planner / calendar that caters to students and users who wish to be more organized and structured. Our app will allow the user to input their events and be notified when the event is coming up. Additionally, we aim to have features that simplify things for the user such as providing directions for them to the events. In providing a simplified user friendly app for scheduling, we hope the user is more inclined to input their events and follow their schedule to be more productive in their day to day activities.

# Application Instructions
The app opens to the Calendar Page, here you can click on a date and then you can either press the create or view button. If you hit the create button, this will take you to a form which you fill out in order to create an event. The first field is the date button which when you press, you can choose a date from a calendar. Then you fill out the Title of the event which is required and any notes you have for the event which is optional. Then you have the option of setting the event as an all day event or choosing a specific time the event is at. You also choose whether your event is at a specific address or if it has no particular location. Lastly you can choose whether you want a reminder notification or not and if so how early in advance you want the reminder to be sent. Once finished you can press Create Event and the app will return you to the Calendar.

The other button you can press on the Calendar page is view. This will take you to the Day View page. Here you can see all the events for the day. For each event there are three buttons, the first is the map icon. This will take you to a page with the address of the event mapped on to a map from Google Maps, you can also press on the icon and be redirected to Google Maps to get directions to this address. The next button is the Edit Button; this allows you to edit an event, the form it takes you to is identical to when you add an event. Lastly, there is a delete button which allows you to delete events.
